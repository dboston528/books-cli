Welcome to the google books cli book management system!
We are currently on version 1.0

After downloading the folder application:

cd into the folder and run npm install, so you have all of your dependencies

After that, you use the following command to search for books using the command line interface:

node book.js search

You will be prompted:
"What book would you like to search for?"

You can input the book of your liking, and up to 5 results will be returned in JSON formatting.

After that, the idea is to be able to select from the results and be able to add one to your collection using MongoDB. That is still in development and will be public soon.
