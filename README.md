# Welcome to the google books cli book management system!

We are currently on version 1.0.0 of th application

After downloading the folder application:

`cd` into the folder and run `npm install`, so you have all of your dependencies.

## I should probably mention the requirements:

Reccomended node version
10.15.1

You can check the node version by running `node -v` in your terminal.

## Don't have node?

Head over to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website to get it installed on your machine.

## How to use the application

After getting everything set up, you can use the following command to search for books using the terminal:

`node books.js search` or `node books.js s`

You will be prompted:
"What book would you like to search for?"

You can input the book of your liking, and up to 5 results will be returned in JSON formatting.

After that, the idea is to be able to select from the results and be able to add one to your collection using MongoDB. That is still in development and will be public soon.
